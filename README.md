# Edinburgh STL Study
I am trying to learn about the current state of Edinburgh Short Term Lets (STLs).

## Definitions
1. **Secondary letting** - letting a property where you do not normally live. For example a second home that is let to guests.
2. **Home letting** - using all or part of your own home for short term lets, while you are absent.
3. **Home sharing** - using all or part of your own home for short term lets, while you are there.
4. **Home letting and home sharing** - using all or part of your own home for short term lets, while you are living there and for periods when you are absent.

All these have a very similar cost, the main difference is that for secondary letting, planning permission is required. So, not only many STL are operating unlicensed, but I suspect many are also under the wrong license. 



## Current key figures:

### 1. Over 1500 unlicensed Airbnbs in Edinburgh
- There are 4005 valid licenses and 5645 STLs only on Airbnb
- In the City Centre, 1513 vs 1935, 22% likely unlicensed
- Penland Hills 66 vs 151, 57% likely unlicensed 

### 2. Likely many licenses are not correct

|License type                 |Count| ----------- |Listing type   |Count|
|-----------------------------|-----|-------------|---------------|-----|
|Secondary letting            |1900 |             |Entire home/apt|3889 |
|Home letting                 |705  |             |Private room   |1726 |
|Home sharing                 |642  |             |Shared room    |30   |
|Home letting and home sharing|764  |

### 3. Some people have a lot of STLs
10 People, have about 400 licenses STLs registered. The worst main one *Mr. John Moffat* he has at least (some licenses don't have a manager) 73 licenses around the city.

But when looking form the Airbnb side, the main one is [Joivy Scotland](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/users/show/37563463) (aka ALTIDO), they have 102 listings in Edinburgh, but only 41 licenses. Another example [Rebecca Webster](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/users/show/3008499) has 51 listings but only 18 licenses.



## Challenges
At this time, it is not possible to easily map a listing to a license. We have the address of the licenses, but only the approximate coordinates of the Airnbbs.
